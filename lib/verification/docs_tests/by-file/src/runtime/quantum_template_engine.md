# Test Specification: `src/runtime/quantum_template_engine.dart`

This file is documented so a future generator can build strong tests from the spec instead of guessing at intent.

## Why this file matters

runtime orchestration, registries, state distribution, and integration safety.

## Source surface discovered

### Public surface

- `_PendingTemplateDef`
- `QTemplateEngine`
- `_LayoutCompileResult`
- `_GridRect`
- `TemplateDef`
- `QTemplateContext`
- `QNativeTemplateBuilder`

### Imports

- `dart:collection`
- `dart:typed_data`
- `package:flutter/foundation.dart`
- `package:flutter/material.dart`
- `package:flutter/rendering.dart`
- `package:flutter/scheduler.dart`
- `package:flutter/services.dart`
- `package:flutter/gestures.dart`
- `../../quantum.dart`

## Testing priorities

- **smoke** — runtime object creation and lookup
- **edges** — empty registry and malformed runtime inputs
- **registry** — register/resolve/remove behavior
- **integration** — state, pipeline, VM, and UI consumers
- **performance** — hot-path reuse and lazy loading
- **regression** — silent stale state and hidden eager loads

## Failure modes this spec must catch

- silent coercion of invalid values
- hidden eager loading before the first access boundary
- duplicate side effects on repeat calls
- stale cache or registry state after mutation
- accidental loss of metadata, ordering, or shape
- incorrect platform fallback selection

## Performance and memory goals

- prefer stable reuse on repeated work
- avoid copying large collections unless the contract says so
- keep first-access work explicit for lazy branches
- keep hot-path lookup cost low
- preserve allocation discipline on repeated mutation

## Integration notes

- dependency `dart:collection` should be validated as a potential compatibility boundary.
- dependency `dart:typed_data` should be validated as a potential compatibility boundary.
- package dependency `package:flutter/foundation.dart` should be pinned or stubbed when behavior could change by platform.
- package dependency `package:flutter/material.dart` should be pinned or stubbed when behavior could change by platform.
- package dependency `package:flutter/rendering.dart` should be pinned or stubbed when behavior could change by platform.
- package dependency `package:flutter/scheduler.dart` should be pinned or stubbed when behavior could change by platform.
- package dependency `package:flutter/services.dart` should be pinned or stubbed when behavior could change by platform.
- package dependency `package:flutter/gestures.dart` should be pinned or stubbed when behavior could change by platform.
- local dependency `../../quantum.dart` is part of the integration surface and should be tested alongside this file.

## YAML companion

- Base manifest: `docs_tests/yaml/by-file/src/runtime/quantum_template_engine.dart.yaml`
- Shared templates: `docs_tests/yaml/shared/case_template.yaml`
- Shared groups: `docs_tests/yaml/shared/group_catalog.yaml`
- Shared axes: `docs_tests/yaml/shared/axis_catalog.yaml`

## Regeneration rule

If this source file changes, this document and its YAML companion should be treated as stale until they are regenerated.

## Supplemental YAML files

This file is large enough to deserve extra YAML partitions. The main manifest points to those parts so a generator can expand them independently.
